Introduction
Welcome to our project, a decentralized, peer-to-peer platform that allows NFT owners to borrow against their NFTs without having to sell them. By leveraging the power of DeFi and the Polygon network, we are creating a safe and secure platform that benefits both NFT owners and lenders.

Getting Started
To get started with our project, follow these steps:

Visit [insert website] to create an account.
Connect your wallet to our platform, ensuring that it is compatible with the Polygon network.
Select the NFT you wish to use as collateral for your loan.
Enter the desired loan amount and loan term.
Review and accept the terms of the loan.
Wait for a lender to accept your loan offer.
Once a lender has accepted your loan offer, the funds will be transferred to your wallet.
Repay the loan, including any applicable interest, by the agreed-upon due date to retrieve your NFT.
If the loan is not repaid by the due date, the NFT will be transferred to the lender.
